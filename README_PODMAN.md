# Using the dnsname plugin with Podman

The *dnsname* plugin allows containers to resolve each other by name.  The plugin adds each
container's name to an instance of a dnsmasq server.  The plugin is enabled through adding it to a network's
CNI configuration.  The containers will only be able to resolve each other if they are on the same CNI network.

**Note**: This plugin does not work with rootless containers.

This tutorial assumes you already have Podman, containernetworking-plugins, and a golang development environment installed.

## Install dnsmasq

Using your package manager, install the *dnsmasq* package.  For Fedora, this would be:
`sudo dnf install dnsmasq`


## Build and install

1. using git, clone the *github.com/containers/dnsname* repository.
2. make install PREFIX=/usr -- this will install the dnsname plugin into /usr/libexec/cni where your CNI plugins
should already exist.

## Configure a CNI network for Podman

1. Create a new network using `podman network create`.  For example, `podman network create foobar` will suffice.

The feature will be automatically enabled for newly created networks via podman network create. If you want to add this feature
to an exisiting network add the needed lines to `/etc/cni/net.d/foobar.conflist` using your favorite editor.
```
{
   "cniVersion": "0.4.0",
   "name": "foobar",
   "plugins": [
      ...
      {
         "type": "dnsname",
         "domainName": "dns.podman"
      }
   ]
}
```

## Example: container name resolution
**Note**: we use the --network foobar here. Also, in this test image, the nginx server will respond with
*podman rulez* on an http request.

```console
sudo podman run -dt --name web --network foobar quay.io/libpod/alpine_nginx:latest
5139d65d22135e9ecab511559d863754550894a32285befd94dab231017048c2

sudo podman run -it --name client --network foobar quay.io/libpod/alpine_nginx:latest curl http://web/
podman rulez
```

## Enabling name resolution on the default Podman network
After making sure the *dnsplugin* is functioning properly, you can add name resolution to your default Podman
network.  This can be done two different ways:

1. Add the *dnsname* plugin as described in above to your default Podman network.  This default network is
usually `/etc/cni/net.d/87-podman-bridge.conflist`.

2. Add a new network as described above and then edit `/etc/containers/libpod.conf` and change the
`cni_default_network` key to your network name.
